# Citi Bike User Prediction

## Excecutive Summary

With the goal of predicting how many users on a particular day are using
Citi Bike, we explored how characteristics in the time of year and
weather help predict the number of riders on a given day. Ridership
shows to be driven primarily by the month of the year and temperature,
with ridership peaking in the summer months and reaching lows in the
winter months. Precipitation and snow also drive down the number of
riders on a day.

Through the use of statistical and machine learning predictive modeling,
we are able to capture about 85% of the signal in the data and improve
prediction accuracy by 64% over baseline.

Given additional need, there are opportunities to further improve the
prediction accuracy through continuous improvement and additional data
source.
